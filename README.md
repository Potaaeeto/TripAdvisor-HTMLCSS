# TripAdvisor - Frontend Clone 🌏

As part of my training at [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) to become a full-stack developer, we were to recreate a clone of [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/)'old website.

_This website is just an exercice and will not be deployed or use, beside as a portfolio._

## Overview 🚀

Check the live demo [here](https://potaaeeto.github.io/TripAdvisor-HTMLCSS/) and test it! 😊
It is fully responsive for all devices, built using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.
